üè†üìä EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON PG (PAYING-GUEST) HOSTELS

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Paying Guest (PG) hostels to uncover trends, pricing patterns, and key factors influencing accommodations. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the analysis examines location-based pricing, amenities, occupancy rates, and customer preferences to help students, professionals, and travelers make data-driven decisions.

Key Objectives:


Analyze price distribution across different localities.

Identify most affordable vs. premium PG options based on amenities.

Explore correlations between rent, facilities (Wi-Fi, meals, AC), and location.

Detect seasonal trends or demand fluctuations in bookings.

Methodology:


Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key metrics (avg. rent, room types).

Visualizations: Interactive plots (box plots, heatmaps, bar charts) for trends.

Geospatial Analysis (if applicable): Mapping PG density & price hotspots.

Insights Generated:


Locality Impact: Rent variations based on proximity to universities/business hubs.

Amenities Influence: How AC, laundry, or meals affect pricing.

Occupancy Trends: Peak booking seasons and vacancy rates.

Tools Used:


Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

Applications:


Helps students/working professionals find budget-friendly PGs.

Assists PG owners in competitive pricing and facility upgrades.

Provides real estate analysts with rental market trends.
