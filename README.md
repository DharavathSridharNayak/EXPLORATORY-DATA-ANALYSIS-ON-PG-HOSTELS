üè†üìä EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON PG (PAYING-GUEST) HOSTELS

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Paying Guest (PG) hostels to uncover trends, pricing patterns, and key factors influencing accommodations. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the analysis examines location-based pricing, amenities, occupancy rates, and customer preferences to help students, professionals, and travelers make data-driven decisions.

Key Objectives:


Analyze price distribution across different localities.

Identify most affordable vs. premium PG options based on amenities.

Explore correlations between rent, facilities (Wi-Fi, meals, AC), and location.


Methodology:


Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Visualizations: Interactive plots (box plots, heatmaps, bar charts) for trends.



Tools Used:


Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook
